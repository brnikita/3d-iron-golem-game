# Audio System Fixes and Improvements

## Enemy Attack Sound Fix

### Problem
Previously, enemies (zombies) were attacking the Iron Golem but no attack sound was playing because:
1. The AudioManager didn't have an 'enemy_attack' sound defined in its list of audio URLs
2. No fallback sound was created for 'enemy_attack'
3. The Enemy class was trying to play a non-existent sound

### Solution
1. Added 'enemy_attack' to the AudioManager's audio URL list using the new zombie_attack_sound.mp3
2. Added a fallback synthetic zombie attack sound with the following characteristics:
   - Guttural growl with distortion
   - Random noise components
   - Harmonic distortion for a more menacing effect
   - Attack-decay envelope for more realistic sound
3. Increased the sound volume to 0.9 for better audibility

## Other Audio Improvements
- Improved fallback sound generation for a more immersive experience
- Added proper error handling for audio loading
- Ensured all sounds have fallbacks in case audio files fail to load

## Testing Notes
- Enemy attacks should now play the zombie attack sound
- If the audio file fails to load, a synthetic zombie growl sound will be used instead
- The sound should have proper 3D positioning (volume decreases with distance from the player)
