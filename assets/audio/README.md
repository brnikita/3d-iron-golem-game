### Background Music

1. Download audio files from the sources above
2. Rename them to match the required filenames
3. Place them in this `assets/audio/` directory
4. Refresh the game - the AudioManager will automatically load them

## Fallback System
If audio files are not found, the game will automatically fall back to synthetic sounds generated by the AudioManager. This ensures the game always has audio, even without external files.

## License Note
Make sure any audio files you add are either:
- Public domain (CC0)
- Creative Commons licensed (with proper attribution)
- Royalty-free for commercial use

The game will work perfectly without these files, but adding them will greatly improve the audio experience!
